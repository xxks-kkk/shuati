Main Idea
*********

.. proof:definition:: subsequence

   A **subsequence** of a sequence :math:`Z` is any sequence obtainable from
   :math:`Z` by removing zero or more elements of :math:`Z`.

.. proof:definition:: longest common subsequence (LCS)

   We are given two sequences :math:`X = x_1, \dots, x_m` and
   :math:`Y = y_1, \dots, y_n`. A **longest common subsequence (LCS)**
   of :math:`X` and :math:`Y` is a longest sequence that is a subsequence
   of both :math:`X` and :math:`Y`.

   .. note::

      We index elements of a sequence with 1 instead of 0. It won't make
      much difference theoretically but it matters for the
      :ref:`implementation <problems/leetcode/1143:Handle Base Case>`.
           
We solve this problem using dynamic programming. For all :math:`i`
and :math:`j` such that :math:`i \in [0,m]` and :math:`j \in [0,n]`, let

.. math::

   a(i,j) = \text{the length of an LCS of }X_i = x_1, \dots, x_i~\text{and}~
   Y_j = y_1, \dots, y_j

There are three possible cases:

- If :math:`i = 0` or :math:`j = 0`, :math:`a(0,j) = 0` and :math:`a(i,0) = 0`
  because elements of a sequence indexed beginning at 0 and when :math:`i = 0`,
  that means :math:`X_i` is non-existent and thus, by the definition of
  :math:`a(i,j)`, :math:`a(0,j) = 0`. Same argument applies for :math:`j = 0`.

For the rest two cases, we assume :math:`i > 0` and :math:`j > 0`.

- If :math:`x_i = y_j`, then there is an LCS of :math:`X_i` and :math:`Y_j` that
  consists of an LCS of :math:`X_{i-1}` and :math:`Y_{j-1}` followed by the symbol
  :math:`x_i = y_j`. Thus, for the length of such LCS, we have :math:`a(i,j) = a(i-1, j-1) + 1`.

- If :math:`x_i \neq y_j`, then an LCS of :math:`X_i` and :math:`Y_j` is
  either an LCS of :math:`X_{i-1}` and :math:`Y_j` or an LCS of :math:`X_i` and :math:`Y_{j-1}`
  depending on which one has longer length. So, for the length, we have
  :math:`a(i,j) = \max(a(i-1,j), a(i,j-1))`.

In summary, we have

.. math::

   \begin{equation} \label{dp-formula}
   a(i,j) =
   \begin{cases}
   0, & \text{if}~i=0~\text{or}~j=0 \\
   a(i-1,j-1) + 1, &\text{if}~i>0~\text{and}~j>0~\text{and}~x_i = y_j \\
   \max(a(i-1,j),a(i,j-1)),              &\text{if}~i>0~\text{and}~j>0~\text{and}~x_i \neq y_j
   \end{cases}
   \end{equation}

We can compute all the :math:`a(i,j)` values in :math:`O(mn)` operations. We can trace backwards in the table
of :math:`a(i,j)` values to obtain an optimal solution in :math:`O(m+n)` operations.

**********************
Implementation Details
**********************

================
Handle Base Case
================

In the above, we consider elements of the sequence with 1-indexed. In actual implementation, the
elements of the sequence (e.g., characters of a string) are often 0-indexed. This can cause
some trouble in the implementation because we need to handle the special case of :math:`a(0,j)` and
:math:`a(i,0)` as they are no longer 0 for sure; they can be 0 or 1. In other words, :math:`a(i,j)`
becomes (denoted as :math:`a'(i,j)`)

.. math::
   
   a'(i,j) = \text{the length of an LCS of }X_i = x_0, \dots, x_i~\text{and}~
   Y_j = y_0, \dots, y_j


Consider two possible examples:

- :math:`X = aaa` and :math:`Y = aa`. Then, :math:`a'(0,j) = 1` for :math:`j \in [0,1]` and
  :math:`a'(i,0) = 1` for :math:`i \in [0,2]`.

- :math:`X = aba` and :math:`Y = b`. Then, :math:`a'(0,0) = 0` but :math:`a'(1,0) = 1` and :math:`a'(2,0) = 1`.        

To avoid special handling for the base case (:math:`i = 0` or :math:`j = 0`), what we can do is to
create a dp table with dimension :math:`(m+1) \times (n+1)` instead of :math:`m \times n`. Doing so,
we follow :math:`\eqref{dp-formula}` precisely and when we compare character, instead of doing 
``text1.charAt(i) == text2.charAt(j)``, we do ``text1.charAt(i-1) == text2.charAt(j-1)``.

Put it differently, to implement :math:`\eqref{dp-formula}` precisely, we need to make dp table
dimension :math:`(m+1) \times (n+1)` instead of :math:`m \times n`.

*******
Variant
*******

The same idea is applicable to the problem of longest common substring (LCS).
We use the same notation of :math:`X = x_1, \dots, x_m` and :math:`Y = y_1, \dots, y_n`.
Then, for all :math:`i` and :math:`j` such that :math:`i \in [0,m]` and :math:`j \in [0,n]`, let

.. math::

   a(i,j) = \text{the length of the common substring that ends at}~x_i~\text{and}~y_j

"ends at :math:`x_i`" means substring that includes :math:`x_i` as the last element.

.. note::

   How :math:`a(i,j)` defined here differs from :math:`a(i,j)` defined previously.

Then, we have   

.. math::

   \begin{equation} \label{dp-formula2}
   a(i,j) =
   \begin{cases}
   0, & \text{if}~i=0~\text{or}~j=0 \\
   a(i-1,j-1) + 1, &\text{if}~i>0~\text{and}~j>0~\text{and}~x_i = y_j \\
   0,              &\text{if}~i>0~\text{and}~j>0~\text{and}~x_i \neq y_j
   \end{cases}
   \end{equation}

Then, the solution is :math:`\max(a(i,j))` for :math:`i \in [0,m]` and :math:`j \in [0,n]`.
