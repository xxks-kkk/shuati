The brute force solution is sufficient for this problem. A few remarks:

- We can use the following nested loops to generate all possible list of length 3 following the same ordering from a given list::

        for (int i = 0; i < list.size(); i++) {
                        for (int j = i + 1; j < list.size(); j++) {
                                            for (int k = j + 1; k < list.size(); k++) {

  In general, to generate all possible length :math:`k`, we need :math:`k` nested loops.

- Be alert the case of "visit the same 3-seq in one user". That is , one user may visit the same pattern multiple times.

- We don't have to sort timestamps and then username and website following the ordering of timestamp at the very beginning.
  We can sort websites by timestamp for each individual user, e.g., ``list.sort(Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a.time));``
