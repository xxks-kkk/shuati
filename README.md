[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/xxks-kkk/shuati.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xxks-kkk/shuati)

This is the respository that put my [systematic algorithm learning](https://github.com/xxks-kkk/algo)
into practice by solving various interview kind of questions.

## Meta

Unlike other similar repos, this repo will use the language that I feel most comfortable for the question I
try to solve. I want to solely focus on the essence behind each question without constraint of choosing
which language to implement.

## Steps to developing a usable algorithm.

- Model the problem.
- Find an algorithm to solve it.
- Fast enough? Fits in memory?
- If not, figure out why not.
- Find a way to address the problem.
- Iterate until satisfied
